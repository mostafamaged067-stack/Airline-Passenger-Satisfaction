# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analytics Project

---

## Executive Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive analytical and predictive study of airline passenger satisfaction. By transforming raw operational and survey data into actionable insights, the project identifies the primary drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, forecasts passenger sentiment, and supports data-driven decision-making through an interactive business intelligence dashboard.

The outcomes of this project are designed to help airlines enhance service quality, improve customer experience, and proactively address areas that negatively impact passenger satisfaction.

---

## Project Objectives

* Analyze passenger behavior and service quality metrics to determine key satisfaction drivers.
* Identify passenger segments with the highest and lowest satisfaction levels.
* Develop predictive models to forecast passenger satisfaction.
* Visualize insights using an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
* Provide data-backed recommendations to improve airline services and operational efficiency.

## Technology Stack

* **Python:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and machine learning
* **Microsoft Excel:** Preliminary data exploration, validation, and summary reporting
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards, KPI monitoring, and executive-level reporting

---

## Analytical Questions

* Which passenger segments demonstrate the highest satisfaction levels?
* What are the primary contributors to passenger dissatisfaction (e.g., delays, seat comfort, onboard services)?
* Are there specific travel times, routes, or flight conditions associated with lower satisfaction?
* How does satisfaction vary across different service categories?

---

## Predictive & Forecasting Questions

* Can passenger satisfaction be accurately predicted prior to or after the flight?
* Which service attributes have the strongest influence on satisfaction outcomes?
* What is the likelihood of dissatisfaction for specific passenger profiles?
* How are satisfaction trends expected to evolve in the upcoming quarter based on current data?
