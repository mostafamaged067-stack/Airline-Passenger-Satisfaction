# 🛫 Airline Passenger Satisfaction Project

---

## 🖌️ Project Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger data to identify key factors affecting satisfaction and dissatisfaction. It applies predictive models to forecast passenger satisfaction levels and builds an interactive dashboard to visualize insights and provide actionable recommendations.

The main goal is to transform raw airline data into meaningful insights that help airlines improve passenger experience and service quality.

## 📊 Key Analysis Questions

- Which passenger groups report the highest satisfaction?
- What are the main factors driving dissatisfaction (e.g., delays, service, comfort)?
- Are there specific flight routes or times with lower satisfaction levels?
- What percentage of passengers are dissatisfied with different service categories?

---

## 📊 Key Forecasting Questions

- Will a passenger be satisfied with their flight experience?
- Which service attributes most influence satisfaction (e.g., cleanliness, food, WiFi)?
- What is the probability of dissatisfaction for different passenger segments?
- How will satisfaction rates change in the next quarter if current trends continue?
